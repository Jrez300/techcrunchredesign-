interface that is a bit of a detour for Amazon\u2019s cloud service. Typically, after all, AWS is all about giving developers all of the tools to build their applications \u2014 but they then have to put all of the pieces together. Honeycode, on the other hand, is meant to appeal to non-coders who want to build basic line-of-business applications. If you know how to work a spreadsheet and want to turn that into an app, Honeycode is all you need. To understand AWS\u2019s motivation behind the service, I talked to AWS VP Larry Augustin and Meera Vaidyanathan, a general manager at AWS. \u201cFor us, it was about extending the power of AWS to more and more users across our customers,\u201d explained Augustin. \u201cWe consistently hear from customers that there are problems they want to solve, they would love to have their IT teams or other teams \u2014 even outsourced help \u2014 build applications to solve some of those problems. But there\u2019s just more demand for some kind of custom application than there are available developers to solve it.\u201d In that respect then, the motivation behind Honeycode isn\u2019t all that different from what Microsoft is doing with its PowerApps low-code tool. That, too, after all, opens up the Azure platform to users who aren\u2019t necessarily full-time developers. AWS is taking a slightly different approach here, though, but emphasizing the no-code part of Honeycode. \u201cOur goal with honey code was to enable the people in the line of business, the business analysts, project managers, program managers who are right there in the midst, to easily create a custom application that can solve some of the problems for them without the need to write any code,\u201d said Augustin. \u201cAnd that was a key piece. There\u2019s no coding required. And we chose to do that by giving them a spreadsheet-like interface that we felt many people would be familiar with as a good starting point.\u201d A lot of low-code/no-code tools also allow developers to then \u201cescape the code,\u201d as Augstin called it, but that\u2019s not the intent here and there\u2019s no real mechanism for exporting code from Honeycode and take it elsewhere, for example. \u201cOne of the tenets we thought about as we were building Honeycode was, gee, if there are things that people want to do and we would want to answer that by letting them escape the code \u2014 we kept coming back and trying to answer the question, \u2018Well, okay, how can we enable that without forcing them to escape the code?\u2019 So we really tried to force ourselves into the mindset of wanting to give people a great deal of power without escaping to code,\u201d he noted. There are, however, APIs that would allow experienced developers to pull in data from elsewhere. Augustin and Vaidyanathan expect that companies may do this for their users on tthe platform or that AWS partners may create these integrations, too. Even with these limitations, though, the team argues that you can build some pretty complex applications. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking to lots of people internally at Amazon who have been building different apps and even within our team and I can honestly say that we haven\u2019t yet come across something that is impossible,\u201d Vaidyanathan said. \u201cI think the level of complexity really depends on how expert of a builder you are. You can get very complicated with the expressions [in the spreadsheet] that you write to display data in a specific way in the app. And I\u2019ve seen people write \u2014 and I\u2019m not making this up \u2014 30-line expressions that are just nested and nested and nested. So I really think that it depends on the skills of the builder and I\u2019ve also noticed that once people start building on Honeycode \u2014 myself included \u2014 I start with something simple and then I get ambitious and I want to add this layer to it \u2014 and I want to do this. That\u2019s really how I\u2019ve seen the journey of builders progress. You start with something that\u2019s maybe just one table and a couple of screens, and very quickly, before you know, it\u2019s a far more robust app that continues to evolve with your needs.\u201d Another feature that sets Honeycode apart is that a spreadsheet sits at the center of its user interface. In that respect, the service may seem a bit like Airtable, but I don\u2019t think that comparison holds up, given that both then take these spreadsheets into very different directions. I\u2019ve also seen it compared to Retool, which may be a better comparison, but Retool is going after a more advanced developer and doesn\u2019t hide the code. There is a reason, though, why these services were built around them and that is simply that everybody is familiar with how to use them. \u201cPeople have been using spreadsheets for decades,\u201d noted Augustin. \u201cThey\u2019re very familiar. And you can write some very complicated, deep, very powerful expressions and build some very powerful spreadsheets. You can do the same with Honeycode. We felt people were familiar enough with that metaphor that we could give them that full power along with the ability to turn that into an app.\u201d The team itself used the service to manage the launch of Honeycode, Vaidyanathan stressed \u2014 and to vote on the name for the product (though Vaidyanathan and Augustin wouldn\u2019t say which other names they considered. \u201cI think we have really, in some ways, a revolutionary product in terms of bringing the power of AWS and putting it in the hands of people who are not coders,\u201d said Augustin."))})),o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Comments"),o.a.createElement("table",null," ",this.commentList()),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"createcomment"},"Create Comment"),o.a.createElement("form",{onSubmit:this.onSubmit},o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("label",null,"Name:"),o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",className:"form-control",value:this.state.comment_name1,onChange:this.onChangeCommentName1})),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("label",null,"Comment:"),o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",className:"form-control",value:this.state.comment_description1,onChange:this.onChangeCommentDescription1})),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("input",{type:"submit",value:"Create Comment",className:"commentBTN"})))))}}]),a}(n.Component),T=function(e){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"commentbox"},o.a.createElement("p",{className:"commentname"},e.comment.comment_name2),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"commentdescription"},e.comment.comment_description2))},_=function(e){Object(h.a)(a,e);var t=Object(u.a)(a);function a(e){var n;return Object(c.a)(this,a),(n=t.call(this,e)).onChangeCommentName2=n.onChangeCommentName2.bind(Object(k.a)(n)),n.onChangeCommentDescription2=n.onChangeCommentDescription2.bind(Object(k.a)(n)),n.onSubmit=n.onSubmit.bind(Object(k.a)(n)),n.state={comment_name2:"",comment_description2:"",comments:[]},n}return Object(m.a)(a,[{key:"onChangeCommentName2",value:function(e){this.setState({comment_name2:e.target.value})}},{key:"onChangeCommentDescription2",value:function(e){this.setState({comment_description2:e.target.value})}},{key:"onSubmit",value:function(e){console.log("Form submitted:"),console.log("Name: ".concat(this.state.comment_name2)),console.log("Comment Description: ".concat(this.state.comment_description2));var t={comment_name2:this.state.comment_name2,comment_description2:this.state.comment_description2};N.a.post("http://localhost:4000/comments/add",t).then((function(e){return console.log(e.data)})),this.setState({comment_name2:"",comment_description2:""})}},{key:"componentDidMount",value:function(){var e=this;N.a.get("http://localhost:4000/comments/").then((function(t){e.setState({comments:t.data})})).catch((function(e){console.log(e)}))}},{key:"commentList",value:function(){return this.state.comments.map((function(e,t){return o.a.createElement(T,{comment:e,key:t})}))}},{key:"render",value:function(){var e=p.filter((function(e){return new RegExp(2).test(e.id)}));return o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("div",{className:"square__post"},e.map((function(e,t){return o.a.createElement("div",{key:t},o.a.createElement("h2",null,e.title),o.a.createElement("img",{src:e.img,alt:e.alt}),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.author),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.date),o.a.createElement("p",null,"New York City is on the verge of approving a shared electric scooter pilot program, opening up a potentially lucrative market and new micromobility battleground in the United States. The New York City Council is expected Thursday to vote on a bill that will require the New York Department of Transportation to create a pilot program for the operation of shared electric scooters in the city. The proposed legislation will first be taken up by the Committee on Transportation at 10 a.m. ET before moving to the full council, which has a meeting scheduled for 1:30 p.m. ET. The committee is expected to approve the measure. The proposed legislation would require the DOT to issue by October 15, 2020 a request for proposals to participate in a shared e-scooter pilot program. The pilot program would need to launch by March 1, 2021. \u201cNew Yorkers need more sustainable and safe ways to commute and get around during this pandemic\u2013and that is especially true for our essential delivery workers who deserve our gratitude and our support for keeping this city running even through the darkest days of this crisis,\u201d New York Council speaker Corey Johnson said in an emailed statement ahead of tomorrow\u2019s vote. \u201cE-bikes and scooters are going to be a major part of our city\u2019s transit future, and I\u2019m proud of the council\u2019s work to ensure that future arrives safely and equitably. \u201dLime  is among several shared electric scooter companies eager to participate in the pilot. The micromobility company has spent the past two years working with elected officials, social justice organizations and advocates to finally make scooters available to New Yorkers, Phil Jones, the senior director of government relations for Lime, told TechCrunch in an email. \u201cThe newfound urgency to offer car-alternative transportation options seems to have gotten us to this point,\u201d Jones said. Bird founder and CEO Travis VanderZanden said the pending vote highlights \u201cthat New York City recognizes the \u2018next\u2019 transportation normal is one that indexes on shared micromobility, such as e-scooters and devolves from cars or ride hail options that contribute to increased pollution and decreased safety throughout communities. \u201dA recent survey conducted by the New York League of Conservation Voters, the Tri-State Transportation Campaign and shared micromobility company Lime suggests there is support for electric scooters in New York City. The survey, which was administered between June 15 to June 19, found 92% of respondents would choose to use scooters as an alternative to cars during the COVID-19 crisis. (It should be noted that the survey was sent to more than 30,000 New Yorkers who are part of the NYLCV, TSTC and Lime networks; 394 people responded). A bevy of companies confirmed to TechCrunch plans to apply for a permit, including Bird, Lyft, Spin and  Link, a new scooter startup that is the shared micromobility arm of Superpedestrian and that just officially launched about a month ago. Link founder and CEO Assaf Biderman is aiming to sell the city on its technology. \u201cWith some of the busiest streets in the country, New York needs micromobility operators who can keep riders moving in bike lanes and out of no-ride zones,\u201d Biderman said. While the proposed legislation was first introduced two years ago, a pilot program wasn\u2019t technically feasible until this April when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill to legalize the use of throttle-based electric scooters and bikes in the state. Under the state law, shared scooters will not be allowed in Manhattan and a pilot program must be approved by the NY City Council before shared scooter services can operate in the remaining boroughs of Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. The proposed local law places some requirements on how the pilot program is structured. Neighborhoods that lack access to existing bike-share programs will be given priority in determining the geographic boundaries of the pilot program. Companies that receive permits will be required to meet operating rules, such as providing accessible scooter options. It\u2019s not clear how many companies will be issued permits or if there will be restrictions on the number of scooters in each fleet. Jones over at Lime said that \u201csuccessful scooter programs strike a careful balance that allows for competition between a handful of operators, but not so many as it becomes oversaturated and unruly. \u201dIn Lime\u2019s view, a successful scooter program will allow for demand to dictate fleet size, include service zones in denser communities with nearby transit options, ensure the zones are expansive enough to connect residential and commercial districts, guarantee access for lower-income neighborhoods as well as provide and capitalize on its unprecedented growth of the bike lane network, Jones added. Will Burns, director of government partnerships for the East Coast at Spin said the most important aspect for NYC regulators to think about when designing this program is how to incentivize companies to make long-term investments for the benefit of the public and their transportation needs. The committee on transportation and full council is also expected to discuss and possibly approve rules about private use of electric bikes and scooters. One proposed law would allow for privately owned scooter use in Manhattan.

One recently released device called the Loupedeck CT can make that an even more enjoyable experience, with customizable controls and profiles that work with just about all your favorite editing apps \u2014 and that can even make just using your computer generally easier and more convenient. The basics. Loupedeck\u2019s entire focus is on creating dedicated hardware control surfaces for creatives, and the Loupedeck CT is its latest, top-of-the-line editing panel. It\u2019s essentially a square block, which is surprisingly thin and light given how many hardware control options it provides. On the surface itself, you\u2019ll find six knobs with tactile, clicky turning action, as well as 12 square buttons and eight round buttons, each of which features color-coded backlighting. There\u2019s also a large central control dial, with a touch-sensitive display in-set, and a 4\xd73 grid of touch-sensitive display buttons up top \u2014 each of which also includes optional vibration feedback when pressed. Loupedeck CT connects via an included USB-C cable (though you\u2019ll need an adapter or your own USB-C to USB-C cable if you\u2019re using a modern MacBook) and it draws all the power it needs to operate from that connection. Small, rubberized pads on the back ensure that it won\u2019t slip around on your desktop or table surface. When you first set up the Loupedeck, you\u2019ll need to download software from the company\u2019s website. Once that\u2019s installed, the setup wizard should see your Loupedeck CT hardware when it\u2019s connected, and present you with configuration options that mirror what will show up on your device. By default, Loupedeck has a number of profiles for popular editing software pre-installed and ready to use, and it\u2019ll switch to use that profile automatically upon opening those applications. The list is fantastic, with one notable (and somewhat painful) exception \u2014 Lightroom CC. This isn\u2019t Loupdeck\u2019s fault: Adobe has changed the way that Lighroom is architected with the CC version such that it no longer offers as much interoperability with plugins like the ones that make Loupedeck work with such high integration. Loupedeck offers a Lightroom Classic profile, and one of the reasons Classic is still available is its rich support for these plugins, so you can still access and edit your library with Loupedeck CT. Plus, you can still use it to control Lightroom CC \u2014 but you\u2019ll have to download a profile that essentially replicates keystrokes and keyboard shortcuts, or create your own, and it won\u2019t be nearly as flexible as the profiles that exist for Photoshop, Photoshop Camera Raw and Lightroom Classic. That one exception aside, there are profiles for just about any creative software a creative pro would want to use. And the default system software settings are also very handy for when you\u2019re not using your computer for doing anything with image, video or audio editing. For instance, I set up basic workflows for capturing screenshots, which I do often for work, and one for managing audio playback during transcription. Design I mentioned it briefly above, but the Loupedeck CT\u2019s design is at first glance very interesting because it\u2019s actually far smaller than I was expecting based on the company\u2019s own marketing and imagery. It\u2019s just a little taller than your average keyboard, and about the same width across, and it takes up not much more space on your desk than a small mousepad, or a large piece of toast. Despite its small footprint, it has a lot of physical controls, each of which is actually potentially many more controls through software. The matte black, slightly rubberized finish is pleasing both to look at and to the touch, and the controls all feel like there was a lot of care put into the tactile experience of using them. The graduated clicks on the knobs let you know when you\u2019ve increased something by a single increment, and the smooth action on the big dial feels delightfully analog. The buttons all have a satisfying, fairly deep click, and the slight buzz you get from the vibration feedback on the touchscreen buttons are a perfect bit of haptic response, which, combined with the raised rows that separate them, mean you can use the Loupedeck CT eyes-free once you get used to it. Each knob is also a clickable button, and the touchscreen circular display on the large central dial can be custom configured with a number of different software buttons or a scroll list. Despite its small size, the Loupedeck CT doesn\u2019t feel fragile, and it has a nice weight to it that feels reassuring of its manufacturing quality. It does feel like a bit of a compromise when it comes to layout to accommodate the square design versus the longer rectangle of the Loupedeck+, which more closely resembles a keyboard \u2014 but that has positives and negatives, since the CT is easier to use alongside a keyboard. Ultimately, the design feels thoughtful and well-considered, giving you a very powerful set of physical controls for creative software that takes up much less space on the desk than even something like an equivalent modular system from Palette would require. Features The Loupedeck CT\u2019s primary benefits are found in its profiles, which set you up out of the box to get editing quickly and effectively across your favorite software. Each feels like a sensible set of defaults for the software they\u2019re designed to work with, and you can always customize and tweak to your heart\u2019s content if you\u2019ve already got a set of standard processes that doesn\u2019t quite match up. Loupedeck\u2019s software makes customization and addition of your own sets of tools a drag-and-drop process, which helps a lot with the learning curve. It still took me a little while to figure out the logic of where to find things, and how they\u2019re nested, but it does make sense once you experiment and play around a bit. Similarly, Loupedeck uses a color-coding hierarchy system in its interface that takes some getting used to, but that eventually provides a handy visual shortcut for working with the Loupedeck CT. There are green buttons and lights that control overall workspaces, as well as purple actions that exist within those workspaces. You can set up multiple workspaces for each app, letting you store entire virtual toolboxes for carrying out specific tasks. This allows the CT to be at once simple enough to not overwhelm, and also rich and complex enough to offer a satisfying range of control options for advanced pros. As mentioned, everything is customizable (minus a few buttons like the o-button that you can\u2019t remap, for navigation reasons) and you can also export profiles for sharing or for use across machines, and import profiles, including those created by others, for quickly getting set up with a new workflow or piece of software. The Loupedeck CT even has 8GB of built-in storage on board, and shows up as a removable disk on your computer, allowing you to easily take your profiles with you \u2014 as well a tidy little collection of working files. Bottom line At $549, the Loupedeck CT isn\u2019t for everyone \u2014 even though the features it offers provide efficiency benefits for many more than just creatives. It\u2019s like having an editing console that you can fit in the tablet pocket of most backpacks or briefcases \u2014 and it\u2019s actually like having a whole bunch of those at once because of the flexibility and configurability of its software. Also, comparable tools like the Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve Editor keyboard can cost more than twice as much. If your job or your passion involves spending considerable time adjusting gradients, curves, degrees and sliders, then the Loupedeck CT is for you. Likewise, if you spend a lot of time transcribing or cleaning up audio, or you\u2019re a keyboard warrior who regularly employs a whole host of keystroke combos even for working in something like a spreadsheet app, it could be great for you too. I\u2019ve tested out a lot of hardware aimed at improving the workflow of photographers and video editors, but none has proven sticky, especially across both home and travel use. The Loupedeck CT seems like the one that will stick, based on my experience with it so far."))})),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"createcomment"},"Comments"),o.a.createElement("p",null," ",this.commentList()),o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Create Comment"),o.a.createElement("form",{onSubmit:this.onSubmit},o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("label",null,"Name:"),o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",className:"form-control",value:this.state.comment_name3,onChange:this.onChangeCommentName3})),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("label",null,"Comment:"),o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",className:"form-control",value:this.state.comment_description3,onChange:this.onChangeCommentDescription3})),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("input",{type:"submit",value:"Create Comment",className:"commentBTN"})))))}}]),a}(n.Component),O=function(e){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"commentbox"},o.a.createElement("p",{className:"commentname"},e.comment.comment_name4),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"commentdescription"},e.comment.comment_description4))},I=function(e){Object(h.a)(a,e);var t=Object(u.a)(a);function a(e){var n;return Object(c.a)(this,a),(n=t.call(this,e)).onChangeCommentName4=n.onChangeCommentName4.bind(Object(k.a)(n)),n.onChangeCommentDescription4=n.onChangeCommentDescription4.bind(Object(k.a)(n)),n.onSubmit=n.onSubmit.bind(Object(k.a)(n)),n.state={comment_name4:"",comment_description4:"",comments:[]},n}return Object(m.a)(a,[{key:"onChangeCommentName4",value:function(e){this.setState({comment_name4:e.target.value})}},{key:"onChangeCommentDescription4",value:function(e){this.setState({comment_description4:e.target.value})}},{key:"onSubmit",value:function(e){console.log("Form submitted:"),console.log("Name: ".concat(this.state.comment_name4)),console.log("Comment Description: ".concat(this.state.comment_description4));var t={comment_name4:this.state.comment_name4,comment_description4:this.state.comment_description4};N.a.post("http://localhost:4000/comments/add",t).then((function(e){return console.log(e.data)})),this.setState({comment_name4:"",comment_description4:""})}},{key:"componentDidMount",value:function(){var e=this;N.a.get("http://localhost:4000/comments/").then((function(t){e.setState({comments:t.data})})).catch((function(e){console.log(e)}))}},{key:"commentList",value:function(){return this.state.comments.map((function(e,t){return o.a.createElement(O,{comment:e,key:t})}))}},{key:"render",value:function(){var e=p.filter((function(e){return new RegExp(4).test(e.id)}));return o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("div",{className:"square__post"},e.map((function(e,t){return o.a.createElement("div",{key:t},o.a.createElement("h2",null,e.title),o.a.createElement("img",{src:e.img,alt:"aws logo"}),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.author),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.date),o.a.createElement("p",null,"The murder of George Floyd was shocking, but we know that his death was not unique. Too many Black lives have been stolen from their families and communities as a result of historical racism. There are deep and numerous threads woven into racial injustice that plague our country that have come to a head following the recent murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Just as important as the process underway to admit to and understand the origin of racial discrimination will be our collective determination to forge a more equitable and inclusive path forward. As we commit to address this intolerable and untenable reality, our discussions must include the role of artificial intelligence (AI) . While racism has permeated our history, AI now plays a role in creating, exacerbating and hiding these disparities behind the facade of a seemingly neutral, scientific machine. In reality, AI is a mirror that reflects and magnifies the bias in our society. I had the privilege of working with Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates to introduce implicit bias training to federal law enforcement at the Department of Justice, which I found to be as educational for those working on the curriculum as it was to those participating. Implicit bias is a fact of humanity that both facilitates (e.g., knowing it\u2019s safe to cross the street) and impedes (e.g., false initial impressions based on race or gender) our activities. This phenomenon is now playing out at scale with AI. As we have learned, law enforcement activities such as predictive policing have too often targeted communities of color, resulting in a disproportionate number of arrests of persons of color. These arrests are then logged into the system and become data points, which are aggregated into larger data sets and, in recent years, have been used to create AI systems. This process creates a feedback loop where predictive policing algorithms lead law enforcement to patrol and thus observe crime only in neighborhoods they patrol, influencing the data and thus future recommendations. Likewise, arrests made during the current protests will result in data points in future data sets that will be used to build AI systems. This feedback loop of bias within AI plays out throughout the criminal justice system and our society at large, such as determining how long to sentence a defendant, whether to approve an application for a home loan or whether to schedule an interview with a job candidate. In short, many AI programs are built on and propagate bias in decisions that will determine an individual and their family\u2019s financial security and opportunities, or lack thereof \u2014 often without the user even knowing their role in perpetuating bias. This dangerous and unjust loop did not create all of the racial disparities under protest, but it reinforced and normalized them under the protected cover of a black box. This is all happening against the backdrop of a historic pandemic, which is disproportionately impacting persons of color. Not only have communities of color been most at risk to contract COVID-19, they have been most likely to lose jobs and economic security at a time when unemployment rates have skyrocketed. Biased AI is further compounding the discrimination in this realm as well. This issue has solutions: diversity of ideas and experience in the creation of AI. However, despite years of promises to increase diversity \u2014 particularly in gender and race, from those in tech who seem able to remedy other intractable issues (from putting computers in our pockets and connecting with machines outside the earth to directing our movements over GPS) \u2014 recently released reports show that at Google and Microsoft, the share of technical employees who are Black or Latinx rose by less than a percentage point since 2014. The share of Black technical workers at Apple has not changed from 6%, which is at least reported, as opposed to Amazon, which does not report tech workforce demographics. In the meantime, ethics should be part of a computer science-related education and employment in the tech space. AI teams should be trained on anti-discrimination laws and implicit bias, emphasizing that negative impacts on protected classes and the real human impacts of getting this wrong. Companies need to do better in incorporating diverse perspectives into the creation of its AI, and they need the government to be a partner, establishing clear expectations and guardrails. There have been bills to ensure oversight and accountability for biased data and the FTC recently issued thoughtful guidance holding companies responsible for understanding the data underlying AI, as well as its implications, and to provide consumers with transparent and explainable outcomes. And in light of the crucial role that federal support is playing and our accelerated use of AI, one of the most important solutions is to require assurance of legal compliance with existing laws from the recipients of federal relief funding employing AI technologies for critical uses. Such an effort was started recently by several members of Congress to safeguard protected persons and classes \u2014 and should be enacted. We all must do our part to end the cycles of bias and discrimination. We owe it to those whose lives have been taken or altered due to racism to look within ourselves, our communities and our organizations to ensure change. As we increasingly rely on AI, we must be vigilant to ensure these programs are helping to solve problems of racial injustice, rather than perpetuate and magnify them."))})),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"createcomment"},"Comments"),o.a.createElement("p",null," ",this.commentList()),o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Create Comment"),o.a.createElement("form",{onSubmit:this.onSubmit},o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("label",null,"Name:"),o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",className:"form-control",value:this.state.comment_name4,onChange:this.onChangeCommentName4})),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("label",null,"Comment:"),o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",className:"form-control",value:this.state.comment_description4,onChange:this.onChangeCommentDescription4})),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("input",{type:"submit",value:"Create Comment",className:"commentBTN"})))))}}]),a}(n.Component),L=function(e){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"commentbox"},o.a.createElement("p",{className:"commentname"},e.comment.comment_name5),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"commentdescription"},e.comment.comment_description5))},D=function(e){Object(h.a)(a,e);var t=Object(u.a)(a);function a(e){var n;return Object(c.a)(this,a),(n=t.call(this,e)).onChangeCommentName5=n.onChangeCommentName5.bind(Object(k.a)(n)),n.onChangeCommentDescription5=n.onChangeCommentDescription5.bind(Object(k.a)(n)),n.onSubmit=n.onSubmit.bind(Object(k.a)(n)),n.state={comment_name5:"",comment_description5:"",comments:[]},n}return Object(m.a)(a,[{key:"onChangeCommentName5",value:function(e){this.setState({comment_name5:e.target.value})}},{key:"onChangeCommentDescription5",value:function(e){this.setState({comment_description5:e.target.value})}},{key:"onSubmit",value:function(e){console.log("Form submitted:"),console.log("Name: ".concat(this.state.comment_name5)),console.log("Comment Description: ".concat(this.state.comment_description5));var t={comment_name5:this.state.comment_name5,comment_description5:this.state.comment_description5};N.a.post("http://localhost:4000/comments/add",t).then((function(e){return console.log(e.data)})),this.setState({comment_name5:"",comment_description5:""})}},{key:"componentDidMount",value:function(){var e=this;N.a.get("http://localhost:4000/comments/").then((function(t){e.setState({comments:t.data})})).catch((function(e){console.log(e)}))}},{key:"commentList",value:function(){return this.state.comments.map((function(e,t){return o.a.createElement(L,{comment:e,key:t})}))}},{key:"render",value:function(){var e=p.filter((function(e){return new RegExp(5).test(e.id)}));return o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("div",{className:"square__post"},e.map((function(e,t){return o.a.createElement("div",{key:t},o.a.createElement("h2",null,e.title),o.a.createElement("img",{src:e.img,alt:"aws logo"}),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.author),o.a.createElement("p",null,e.date),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Earlier today we took a look at two companies that have filed to go public, nCino and GoHealth. The pair join Lemonade in a march toward the public markets. But those three firms are hardly alone. We know that DoorDash filed privately earlier this year (it also raised a pile of cash lately, so its IPO may not be in a hurry), and Postmates filed privately last year. Even more, there are a number of companies whose IPOs we anticipate in short order. So, what follows is our incredibly scientific survey of impending IPOs, starting with those closest to the gate. This list is focused on companies that were at one point venture-backed startups, even if they have become behemoths in the intervening years. We\u2019ll start with companies that have filed and are moving toward debuts in the next few weeks: nCino: This SaaS company is growing nicely, and has pretty good overall economics. We covered its financial history here. Its debut will be a win for North Carolina. GoHealth: A Chicago success story that was swallowed by private equity last year, GoHealth is now an incredibly complicated company and offering that features lots of long-term indebtedness. But, its exit should provide reasonable returns to its current owner\u2019s backers, who held onto the firm for less than a year before trying to flip it. Lemonade: Lemonade\u2019s IPO is an important moment for a number of modern insurance companies like Root, MetroMile, Kin and others. Not that they all sell the same type of insurance, mind, they don\u2019t. Lemonade does rental and home insurance, while Root and MetroMile are focused on autos, for example. But if Lemonade manages a strong offering, it could provide tailwind to its fellow neo-insurance providers all the same. Agora: We\u2019re catching up on the Agora debut. The China-based company\u2019s IPO filing details a company that provides other companies and developers the ability to \u201cembed real-time video and voice functionalities into their applications without the need to develop the technology or build the underlying infrastructure themselves\u201d via APIs. This sounds a bit like what Daily.co is building, if you recall that round. Agora is a company that has good operating income and net income before \u201caccretion on convertible redeemable preferred shares to redemption value.\u201d With that in hand, the company\u2019s earnings are sharply negative. Read that how you want. Agora wants to raise between $280 million and $315 million. (Update: Agora reached out to TechCrunch, noting that it also has an HQ in the United States. We called it China-based above given that the first listed address in its F-1 filing is in China, and that it filed an F-1 filing as opposed to an S-1. The company\u2019s other HQ is in Santa Clara, California.) And, next, companies that have filed privately but are still hanging back: DoorDash: With lots of new money, DoorDash may not be in a rush to go public. That said, this offering is easily a top-three, most-anticipated offering. And as the company certainly wants to get out while the markets are recovered, perhaps there\u2019s some ambient pressure on the firm to make its private IPO filing public. Postmates: Postmates filed privately to go public last year. Since then it has raised a bunch more money. It\u2019s now just keeping along. Go public, Postmates! We want to see your numbers! Asana: Asana  filed privately to go public earlier this year, which was exciting. Then it didn\u2019t go public, which wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s doing some stuff with Microsoft lately, which is neat. But when we asked the company to stop messing about and give us that S-1, co-founder Dustin Moskovitz told us \u201cNo!\u201d Adding to this particular trail of breadcrumbs, Asana crossed the $100 million ARR mark over a year ago, and added some new board members in the interim. BigCommerce: Bloomberg reported earlier today that the company is going public, and has filed privately to do so. BigCommerce is an Austin-based SaaS service that provides e-commerce tools to merchants. It\u2019s like an American Shopify, kinda. And backed by over $200 million in venture capital, there\u2019s a lot of bets riding on its eventual debut. Save us the wait, BigCommerce, and file publicly today. And here are companies that are making the sort of noise that one might make before finally going public: Airbnb: Airbnb  promised to go public, then COVID-19 happened, and the company had to raise a bunch of expensive capital and lay off around a quarter of its staff. But now it\u2019s bouncing back, and could still go public this year, according to its CEO. Please do, Airbnb, I want to see your numbers. Palantir: I am loath to include Palantir in this list, as it\u2019s been on future IPO lists since time immemorial (here\u2019s an example); but, hey, maybe this time it will happen. Why do we think that? Here are two headlines to make it plain: \u201cPalantir Notches $500M Ahead Of Potential IPO\u201d from June 19th, and \u201cPalantir to File IPO in Weeks For Possible Fall Debut\u201d from June 11, 2020. So, yeah, this is a thing. All of the above is a jam, and I am stoked to dig through the S-1 trenches with you."))})),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"createcomment"},"Comments"),o.a.createElement("p",null," ",this.commentList()),o.a.createElement("h3",null,"Create Comment"),o.a.createElement("form",{onSubmit:this.onSubmit},o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("label",null,"Name:"),o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",className:"form-control",value:this.state.comment_name5,onChange:this.onChangeCommentName5})),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("label",null,"Comment:"),o.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",className:"form-control",value:this.state.comment_description5,onChange:this.onChangeCommentDescription5})),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"form-group"},o.a.createElement("input",{type:"submit",value:"Create Comment",className:"commentBTN"})))))}}]),a}(n.Component);var P=function(){return o.a.createElement(s.a,null,o.a.createElement(w,null),o.a.createElement(l.c,null,o.a.createElement(l.a,{path:"/",component:d,exact:!0}),o.a.createElement(l.a,{path:"/articles",component:f}),o.a.createElement(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/article1",component:S}),o.a.createElement(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/article2",component:_}),o.a.createElement(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/article3",component:x}),o.a.createElement(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/article4",component:I}),o.a.createElement(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/article5",component:D}),o.a.createElement(l.a,{path:"/events",component:b}),o.a.createElement(l.a,{path:"/contact",component:v})),o.a.createElement(E,null))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(o.a.createElement(s.a,null,o.a.createElement(P,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[34,1,2]]]);
